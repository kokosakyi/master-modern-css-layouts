                        The King is usually the tallest piece in the set.
                        The king is the most important piece on the chessboard.
                        When the king is trapped, or in chess terms 'checkmated', by
                        the opposition pieces and cannot escape, the game is lost and
                        ends immediately.

                        The queen is the most powerful piece on the chessboard.

                    <p>
                        Each chess player has two bishops. There is the light squared bishop and the dark squared
                        bishop.
                        On a single turn, the bishop can move any number of vacant squares along the diagonal on which
                        it stands

                    <p>
                        The knight can be moved to one of the nearest squares to that on which it stands, but not on the
                        same rank, file or diagonal.
                        It moves in L-shape. For closed positions, the knight's effectiveness shines.

                    <p>
                        The rook can be moved any number of squares along the file or rank on which it stands.
                        The rook is also often referred to as the castle due to its resemblance to a castle.

                    <p>
                        Alas the pawn. The name of the piece derives from the latin for 'foot'.
                        It is thus, the foot soldier, least valued but very crucial.
                        The pawn matches forth with the hope of advancing all the way to the enemy's last rank.
                        If it should prevail on this arduous journey it can become as powerful as the queen.
